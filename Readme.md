A short description of the files and folders in the repository follows:

#### Folders
*NeuralProphetPapersUsed*: A folder containing some reference paper on the NeuralProphet framework

*VanillaProphetOutput*: A folder containing figures with results from running the a simple model using Prophet framework on the sales data

*data*: A folder with the original data and some staging data as well

*m32_runs: A folder containing figures and results from running 8 model made using the NeuralProphet forecasting framework to forecast fuel sales for one month at a time

*model_runs: A folder containing figures and results from running 8 model made using the NeuralProphet forecasting framework to forecast fuel sales for one day at a time

*models_1d*: A folder containing saved models for variant and each station for one day models

*models_31d*: A folder containing saved models for variant and each station for one month models

#### Notebooks
